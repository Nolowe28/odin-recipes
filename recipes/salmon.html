        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Cooking salmon in an air fryer is a quick and easy way to enjoy this delicious fish. 
                The air fryer uses hot air to circulate around the food, which results in a crispy 
                and golden exterior and a moist and tender interior. To cook salmon in the air fryer, 
                simply season the fish with your favorite herbs and spices, place it in the air fryer 
                basket, and cook for 8-10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish. The result 
                is a perfectly cooked and flavorful salmon that is ready to be served in minutes. Plus, 
                cooking in an air fryer is healthier than frying in oil, as it uses little to no oil, 
                making it a great option for those watching their fat intake.</p>
