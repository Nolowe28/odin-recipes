enhance my knowledge and skills in writing HTML code. 

Some of my goals for this project are to: 
 -become more familiar with the HTML syntax by using HTML elements to outline a website.
 -gain speed in typing out HTML elements.
 -build a foundation upon which I can become a professional web developer.
